\title{Get summary attributes from a time-series index}
\usage{
tk_get_timeseries_signature(idx)

tk_get_timeseries_summary(idx)
}
\arguments{
\item{idx}{A time-series index that is a vector of dates or datetimes.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{tibble} object describing the timeseries.
}
\description{
Get summary attributes from a time-series index
}
\details{
\code{tk_get_timeseries_signature} decomposes the timeseries into commonly
needed features such as
numeric value, differences,
year, month, day, day of week, day of month,
day of year, hour, minute, second.

\code{tk_get_timeseries_summary} returns the summary returns the
start, end, units, scale, and a "summary" of the timeseries differences
in seconds including
the minmum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, and maximum frequency.
The timeseries
differences give the user a better picture of the index frequency
so the user can understand the level of regularity or irregulairity.
A perfectly regular time series will have equal values in seconds for each metric.
However, this is not often the case.

\strong{Important Note}: These functions only work with time-based indexes in
datetime, date, yearmon, and yearqtr values. Regularized dates cannot be decomposed.
